This is generated from the Yeoman angular scaffold with grunt and uses express(nodejs) as a Backend.

Note: You need to have bower, grunt installed in your system.

If you dont have npm, install npm first. Then,

	npm install -g bower
	npm install -g grunt-cli

Note: You also need to have ruby and compass installed for the compass plugin to work.

If you dont have ruby installed, install it first and then,

	sudo gem install compass

If you already have ruby installed,

	sudo gem update --system && sudo gem install compass

Clone the repo and cd into it.

	npm install
	bower install

Done :)
